# BitDon8.com - About

BitDon8 is a platform to donate with CPU power and blockchain technology. You can decide for whom to mine Monero (XMR). Monero is an open-source cryptocurrency created in April 2014 that focuses on privacy and decentralization. While you are surfing on the Internet, just open bitdon8.com and hit the start button on any organizations page. After that BitDon8 manages the rest of the work.

## How it works

BitDon8 builds up connections to XMRPOOL via our special Websocket And Stratum Proxy. The Microservices run in Docker containers and orchestrated by Kubernetes cluster. Each and every organization have their own Monero wallet, where they collect virtual money. They can use it for good purpose. Our Twitter service creates a tweet every day with the results of the day.

## Support This Project

The project has a donation mechanism built in.  By default it donates for 1 minute and 12 seconds (donate=2) of every hour.  It does this without breaking your pool connection.  This is configurable down to 36 seconds (donate=1) per hour.  Or higher if you feel generous. Saavy users of course may find that they can disable the donation mechanism.  If you do so, consider a one time donation.
